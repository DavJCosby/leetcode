# leetcode
 
I've had this annoying problem for a while where I feel like I'm rusty in every programming language I know except the one I last used for a project. To combat that, I'm starting a leetcode grind where before each problem I have to [spin a wheel](https://pickerwheel.com/pw?id=yvqiY) and randomly select one of the languages I know (or am learning) and complete the challenge using it.
